# 🧠 Social Media Sentiment & Engagement Analysis
**Exploring how sentiment, engagement, and platform dynamics shape online conversations**

---

## 📊 Overview
This project builds an **end-to-end analytics workflow in R** to explore how people engage with content across social media platforms.  
It combines **sentiment classification**, **engagement clustering**, and **interactive data visualization** to uncover patterns in audience reactions and post performance.

---

## 🧩 Key Highlights
- Trained multiple models — **Naive Bayes**, **Decision Trees**, and **Random Forests** — to classify post sentiment.  
- Performed **K-Means clustering** on engagement metrics (likes, comments, shares) to identify audience behavior groups.  
- Created **interactive dashboards** using **Plotly** and **visNetwork** for dynamic exploration of engagement and decision paths.  
- Visualized explainable insights such as **feature importance**, **sentiment proportions**, and **cluster relationships** using **ggplot2**.
